        <h4> <b> 2. Job Portal </b></h4>
        <br>  <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;"> In today’s competitive environment, getting jobs and searching for candidates assumes <br/><br/>
greater importance. Earlier, the advertisements of jobs were limited to newspapers. But now the emerging economy demands the situation to change. We have various job portals, online employment exchanges, consultancies, company websites etc. In this situation recruitment should be time saving, cost effective and at the same time should search out the qualified candidates.By using the efficient methods and techniques the recruitment process is made easy. The employers and candidates see things not in terms of what they need, but in terms of best things they want. The client hunted a job portal which is meant for Employers, jobseekers, and also which guides the candidates in various areas of job search and related things.Finding and recruiting the best quality candidates seems to get more complicated in the coming days. So the proposed system aimed to provide best class of employment services to job seekers, employers, and recruiters. The system should provide free job search and 
services. It should be quick, safe and easy to use. The system is meant for the end users -the employer and the candidate. The end users may be registered users or not registered. <br/><br/> The modules of the project would be​: <br/>➢ Jobseeker account <br/> ➢ Employer account  <br/>  ➢ Employer job posting  <br/>  ➢ Jobseeker receiving relevant jobs  <br/> ➢ Fetching job description </p> <br/> <br/>
